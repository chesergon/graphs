Graph Representation in JavaScript
This repository demonstrates various ways to represent and manipulate graphs in JavaScript. We explore three common representations:

Adjacency Matrix
Adjacency List
Incidence Matrix
Adjacency Matrix
An adjacency matrix is a 2D array where matrix[i][j] is 1 if there is an edge between vertex i and vertex j, and 0 otherwise.

Adjacency List
An adjacency list represents a graph as a map from vertices to lists of adjacent vertices. This is more space-efficient for sparse graphs.

Incidence Matrix
An incidence matrix is a V x E matrix where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. The entry matrix[i][j] is 1 if vertex i is incident to edge j.



This README provides a brief overview of graph representations. For detailed implementation, refer to the code in the repository.
